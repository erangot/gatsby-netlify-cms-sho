**Sho.co is a sharing website for videos made with Sparkol apps.**

Sho.co delivers your finished videos much faster than rendering them in the app.



Once your videos are live on sho.co, you can:

### **Download your videos**

Sho.co is the quickest way to get your hands on your videos. No quality spared – download in HD.

### **Share your videos**

Show your video to friends, colleagues or students by sharing the short link.

### **Embed onto your own website**

Place your videos onto your own website or blog using the unique embed code.

### **More on the way**

Sho.co is a new service from Sparkol. We have big plans for the platform.
